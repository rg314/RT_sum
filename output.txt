title = fluorescence enhancement and strong coupling in faceted plasmonic nanocavities

abstract = emission properties of a quantum emitter can be significantly modified inside nanometre sized gaps between two plasmonic nanostructures . this forms a nanoscopic optical cavity which allows single molecule detection and single molecule strong coupling at room temperature . however plasmonic resonances of a plasmonic nanocavity are highly sensitive to the exact gap morphology . in this article we shed light on the effect of gap morphology on the plasmonic resonances of a faceted nanoparticle on mirror nanocavity and their interaction with quantum emitters . we find that with increasing facet width the npom nanocavity provides weaker field enhancement and thus less coupling strength to a single quantum emitter since the effective mode volume increases with the facet width . however if multiple emitters are present a faceted npom nanocavity is capable of accommodating a larger number of emitters and hence the overall coupling strength is larger due to the collective and coherent energy exchange from all the emitters . our findings pave the way to more efficient designs of nanocavities for room temperature light matter strong coupling thus providing a big step forward to a non cryogenic platform for quantum technologies .

title = gyroid optical metamaterials calculating the effective permittivity of multidomain samples

abstract = gold gyroid optical metamaterials are known to possess a reduced plasma frequency and linear dichroism imparted by their intricate subwavelength single gyroid morphology . the anisotropic optical properties are however only evident when a large individual gyroid domain is investigated . multidomain gyroid metamaterials fabricated using a polyisoprene polystyrene poly triblock terpolymer and consisting of multiple small gyroid domains with random orientation and handedness instead exhibit isotropic optical properties . comparing three effective medium models we here show that the specular reflectance spectra of such multidomain gyroid optical metamaterials can be accurately modeled over a broad range of incident angles by a bruggeman effective medium consisting of a random wire array . this model accurately reproduces previously published results tracking the variation in normal incidence reflectance spectra of gold gyroid optical metamaterials as a function of host refractive index and volume fill fraction of gold . the effective permittivity derived from this theory confirms the change in sign of the real part of the permittivity in the visible spectral region . that a bruggeman effective medium can accurately model the experimental reflectance spectra implies that small multidomain gold gyroid optical metamaterials behave both qualitatively and quantitatively as an amorphous composite of gold and air and that coherent electromagnetic contributions arising from the subwavelength gyroid symmetry are not dominant .

title = spatiotemporal dynamics and control of strong coupling in plasmonic nanocavities

abstract = in the light matter strong coupling regime the excited state of quantum emitters is inextricably linked to a photonic mode leading to hybrid states that are part light and part matter . recently there has been a huge effort to realize strong coupling with nanoplasmonics since it provides a versatile environment to study and control molecules in ambient conditions . among the most promising designs are plasmonic nanocavities that confine light to unprecedentedly small volumes . such nanocavities though support multiple types of modes with different field profiles and radiative decay rates . here we show theoretically that the different nature of these modes leads to mode beating within the nanocavity and the rabi oscillations which alters the spatiotemporal dynamics of the hybrid system . by specifically designing the illumination setup we decompose and control the dark and bright plasmon mode excitation and therefore their coupling with quantum emitters . hence this work opens new routes for dynamically dressing emitters to tailor their hybrid states with external radiation .

abstract = nanoparticle encapsulation inside zirconium based metal organic frameworks is hard to control and the resulting materials often have nonuniform morphologies with nps on the external surface of mofs and np aggregates inside the mofs . in this work we report the controlled encapsulation of gold nanorods by a scu topology zr mof via a room temperature mof assembly . this is achieved by functionalizing the aunrs with poly surface ligands allowing them to retain colloidal stability in the precursor solution and to seed the mof growth . using this approach we achieve core shell yields exceeding tuning the mof particle size via the solution concentration of aunrs . the functionality of aunr mofs is demonstrated by using the aunrs as embedded probes for selective surface enhanced raman spectroscopy . the aunr mofs are able to both take up or block molecules from the pores thereby facilitating highly selective sensing at the aunr ends . this proof of principle study serves to present both the outstanding level of control in the synthesis and the high potential for aunr zr mof composites for sers .

title = plasmonic tunnel junctions for single molecule redox chemistry

abstract = nanoparticles attached just above a flat metallic surface can trap optical fields in the nanoscale gap . this enables local spectroscopy of a few molecules within each coupled plasmonic hotspot with near thousand fold enhancement of the incident fields . as a result of non radiative relaxation pathways the plasmons in such sub nanometre cavities generate hot charge carriers which can catalyse chemical reactions or induce redox processes in molecules located within the plasmonic hotspots . here surface enhanced raman spectroscopy allows us to track these hot electron induced chemical reduction processes in a series of different aromatic molecules . we demonstrate that by increasing the tunnelling barrier height and the dephasing strength a transition from coherent to hopping electron transport occurs enabling observation of redox processes in real time at the single molecule level .

abstract = noble metallic nanostructures provide a platform for high sensitivity spectroscopic sensing with significantly enhanced electromagnetic fields due to surface plasmon polaritons . however target molecules can be transformed into other molecules under irradiation with an excitation laser during the surface enhanced measurement which thus disturbs detection of unknown samples . in this paper we perform raman measurements of aminothiophenol on gold nanosurfaces with and without deposition of sio thin films at the surface . the raman signals are enhanced on both substrates but the deposition of the glass thin film clearly prevents the chemical transformation . this indicates that hot electrons are effective for chemical transformation and that thin glass films are sufficient to prevent this while still benefiting from surface plasmons .

abstract = open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build scientific instruments with the advent of readily available printers mechanical designs can now be shared improved and replicated faster and more easily than ever before . however printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms . we have overcome many of the limitations of printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic printed flexure translation stage capable of sub micron scale motion over a range of x mm . this requires minimal post print clean up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors . the resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift moving less than mu over the course of a week without temperature stabilisation . this enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability perfect for time lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood . the ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel . high performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond . author .

title = sers of individual nanoparticles on a mirror size does matter but so does shape

abstract = coupling noble metal nanoparticles by a nm gap to an underlying gold mirror confines light to extremely small volumes useful for sensing on the nanoscale . individually measuring of such gold nanoparticles of increasing size dramatically shows the different scaling of their optical scattering and surface enhanced raman emission . linear red shifts of the coupled plasmon modes are seen with increasing size matching theory . the total sers from the few hundred molecules under each nanoparticle dramatically increases with increasing size . this scaling shows that maximum sers emission is always produced from the largest nanoparticles irrespective of tuning to any plasmonic resonances . changes of particle facet with nanoparticle size result in vastly weaker scaling of the near field sers without much modifying the far field and allows simple approaches for optimizing practical sensing .

title = fluorescence enhancement and strong coupling in faceted plasmonic nanocavities

abstract = emission properties of a quantum emitter can be significantly modified inside nanometre sized gaps between two plasmonic nanostructures . this forms a nanoscopic optical cavity which allows single molecule detection and single molecule strong coupling at room temperature . however plasmonic resonances of a plasmonic nanocavity are highly sensitive to the exact gap morphology . in this article we shed light on the effect of gap morphology on the plasmonic resonances of a faceted nanoparticle on mirror nanocavity and their interaction with quantum emitters . we find that with increasing facet width the npom nanocavity provides weaker field enhancement and thus less coupling strength to a single quantum emitter since the effective mode volume increases with the facet width . however if multiple emitters are present a faceted npom nanocavity is capable of accommodating a larger number of emitters and hence the overall coupling strength is larger due to the collective and coherent energy exchange from all the emitters . our findings pave the way to more efficient designs of nanocavities for room temperature light matter strong coupling thus providing a big step forward to a non cryogenic platform for quantum technologies .

abstract = gold gyroid optical metamaterials are known to possess a reduced plasma frequency and linear dichroism imparted by their intricate subwavelength single gyroid morphology . the anisotropic optical properties are however only evident when a large individual gyroid domain is investigated . multidomain gyroid metamaterials fabricated using a polyisoprene polystyrene poly triblock terpolymer and consisting of multiple small gyroid domains with random orientation and handedness instead exhibit isotropic optical properties . comparing three effective medium models we here show that the specular reflectance spectra of such multidomain gyroid optical metamaterials can be accurately modeled over a broad range of incident angles by a bruggeman effective medium consisting of a random wire array . this model accurately reproduces previously published results tracking the variation in normal incidence reflectance spectra of gold gyroid optical metamaterials as a function of host refractive index and volume fill fraction of gold . the effective permittivity derived from this theory confirms the change in sign of the real part of the permittivity in the visible spectral region . that a bruggeman effective medium can accurately model the experimental reflectance spectra implies that small multidomain gold gyroid optical metamaterials behave both qualitatively and quantitatively as an amorphous composite of gold and air and that coherent electromagnetic contributions arising from the subwavelength gyroid symmetry are not dominant .

abstract = in the light matter strong coupling regime the excited state of quantum emitters is inextricably linked to a photonic mode leading to hybrid states that are part light and part matter . recently there has been a huge effort to realize strong coupling with nanoplasmonics since it provides a versatile environment to study and control molecules in ambient conditions . among the most promising designs are plasmonic nanocavities that confine light to unprecedentedly small volumes . such nanocavities though support multiple types of modes with different field profiles and radiative decay rates . here we show theoretically that the different nature of these modes leads to mode beating within the nanocavity and the rabi oscillations which alters the spatiotemporal dynamics of the hybrid system . by specifically designing the illumination setup we decompose and control the dark and bright plasmon mode excitation and therefore their coupling with quantum emitters . hence this work opens new routes for dynamically dressing emitters to tailor their hybrid states with external radiation .

abstract = practical challenges to extrapolating moore law favour alternatives to electrons as information carriers . two promising candidates are spin based and all optical architectures the former offering lower energy consumption the latter superior signal transfer down to the level of chip interconnects . polaritons spinor quasi particles composedof semiconductor excitons and microcavity photons directly couple exciton spins and photon polarizations combining the advantages of both approaches . however their implementation for spintronics has been hindered because polariton spins can be manipulated only optically or by strong magnetic fields . here we use an external electric field to directly control the spin of a polariton condensate bias tuning the emission polarization . the nonlinear spin dynamics offers an alternative route to switching allowing us to realize an electrical spinswitch exhibiting ultralow switching energies below number fj . our results lay the foundation for development of devices based on the electro optical control of coherent spin ensemblesona chip .

title = fluorescence enhancement and strong coupling in faceted plasmonic nanocavities

abstract = emission properties of a quantum emitter can be significantly modified inside nanometre sized gaps between two plasmonic nanostructures . this forms a nanoscopic optical cavity which allows single molecule detection and single molecule strong coupling at room temperature . however plasmonic resonances of a plasmonic nanocavity are highly sensitive to the exact gap morphology . in this article we shed light on the effect of gap morphology on the plasmonic resonances of a faceted nanoparticle on mirror nanocavity and their interaction with quantum emitters . we find that with increasing facet width the npom nanocavity provides weaker field enhancement and thus less coupling strength to a single quantum emitter since the effective mode volume increases with the facet width . however if multiple emitters are present a faceted npom nanocavity is capable of accommodating a larger number of emitters and hence the overall coupling strength is larger due to the collective and coherent energy exchange from all the emitters . our findings pave the way to more efficient designs of nanocavities for room temperature light matter strong coupling thus providing a big step forward to a non cryogenic platform for quantum technologies .

title = gyroid optical metamaterials calculating the effective permittivity of multidomain samples

abstract = gold gyroid optical metamaterials are known to possess a reduced plasma frequency and linear dichroism imparted by their intricate subwavelength single gyroid morphology . the anisotropic optical properties are however only evident when a large individual gyroid domain is investigated . multidomain gyroid metamaterials fabricated using a polyisoprene polystyrene poly triblock terpolymer and consisting of multiple small gyroid domains with random orientation and handedness instead exhibit isotropic optical properties . comparing three effective medium models we here show that the specular reflectance spectra of such multidomain gyroid optical metamaterials can be accurately modeled over a broad range of incident angles by a bruggeman effective medium consisting of a random wire array . this model accurately reproduces previously published results tracking the variation in normal incidence reflectance spectra of gold gyroid optical metamaterials as a function of host refractive index and volume fill fraction of gold . the effective permittivity derived from this theory confirms the change in sign of the real part of the permittivity in the visible spectral region . that a bruggeman effective medium can accurately model the experimental reflectance spectra implies that small multidomain gold gyroid optical metamaterials behave both qualitatively and quantitatively as an amorphous composite of gold and air and that coherent electromagnetic contributions arising from the subwavelength gyroid symmetry are not dominant .

title = spatiotemporal dynamics and control of strong coupling in plasmonic nanocavities

abstract = in the light matter strong coupling regime the excited state of quantum emitters is inextricably linked to a photonic mode leading to hybrid states that are part light and part matter . recently there has been a huge effort to realize strong coupling with nanoplasmonics since it provides a versatile environment to study and control molecules in ambient conditions . among the most promising designs are plasmonic nanocavities that confine light to unprecedentedly small volumes . such nanocavities though support multiple types of modes with different field profiles and radiative decay rates . here we show theoretically that the different nature of these modes leads to mode beating within the nanocavity and the rabi oscillations which alters the spatiotemporal dynamics of the hybrid system . by specifically designing the illumination setup we decompose and control the dark and bright plasmon mode excitation and therefore their coupling with quantum emitters . hence this work opens new routes for dynamically dressing emitters to tailor their hybrid states with external radiation .

title = anomalously large spectral shifts near the quantum tunnelling limit in plasmonic rulers with subatomic resolution

abstract = the resonance wavelength of a coupled plasmonic system is extremely sensitive to the distance between its metallic surfaces resulting in plasmon rulers . we explore this behavior in the subnanometer regime using self assembled monolayers of bis phthalocyanine molecules in a nanoparticle on mirror construct . these allow unprecedented subangstrom control over spacer thickness via choice of metal center in a gap size regime at the quantum mechanical limit of plasmonic enhancement . dramatic shift in the coupled plasmon resonance is observed as the gap size is varied from number to number nm . existing theoretical models are unable to account for the observed spectral tuning which requires inclusion of the quantum classical interface emphasizing the need for new treatments of light at the subnanoscale .

title = linking classical and molecular optomechanics descriptions of sers

abstract = the surface enhanced raman scattering of molecular species in plasmonic cavities can be described as an optomechanical process where plasmons constitute an optical cavity of reduced effective mode volume which effectively couples to the vibrations of the molecules . an optomechanical hamiltonian can address the full quantum dynamics of the system including the phonon population build up the vibrational pumping regime and the stokes anti stokes correlations of the photons emitted . here we describe in detail two different levels of approximation to the methodological solution of the optomechanical hamiltonian of a generic sers configuration and compare the results of each model in light of recent experiments . furthermore a phenomenological semi classical approach based on a rate equation of the phonon population is demonstrated to be formally equivalent to that obtained from the full quantum optomechanical approach . the evolution of the raman signal with laser intensity is accurately addressed when this phenomenological semi classical approach is properly extended to account for the anti stokes process . the formal equivalence between semi classical and molecular optomechanics descriptions allows us to describe the vibrational pumping regime of sers through the classical cross sections which characterize a nanosystem thus setting a roadmap to describing molecular optomechanical effects in a variety of experimental situations .

title = actuating single nano oscillators with light

abstract = thermoresponsive polymers can be used to rapidly actuate individual nanoparticles forming nanomechanical oscillators . such systems are realized here with poly coated gold nanoparticles deposited on gold films which have a strong optical response that can be dynamically tracked . changes in temperature surrounding the nanoparticles result in the contraction or expansion of the pnipam coating thereby displacing the gold nanoparticles up and down on the gold mirror . particle oscillation is optically monitored via the spectral position of the coupled plasmon modes achieving sub millisecond translocation speeds when actuated by light via plasmonic heating . these fast nano oscillators can also generate forces exceeding nn with efficiencies already exceeding which makes them ideal prototypes for nanomachines .

title = single molecule optomechanics in picocavities 

abstract = trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of cubic nanometers . we found that individual atomic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below cubic nanometer enabling optical experiments on the atomic scale . these atomic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiation . although unstable at room temperature picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures allowing single atomic cavities to be probed for many minutes . unlike traditional optomechanical resonators such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrations of individualmolecular bonds . this work sets the basis for developing nanoscale nonlinear quantum optics on the single molecule level .

title = tunable magnetic alignment between trapped exciton polariton condensates

abstract = tunable spin correlations are found to arise between two neighboring trapped exciton polariton condensates which spin polarize spontaneously . we observe a crossover from an antiferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic pair state by reducing the coupling barrier in real time using control of the imprinted pattern of pump light . fast optical switching of both condensates is then achieved by resonantly but weakly triggering only a single condensate . these effects can be explained as the competition between spin bifurcations and spin preserving josephson coupling between the two condensates and open the way to polariton bose hubbard ladders .

title = near field optical drilling of sub lambda pits in thin polymer films

abstract = under uv illumination polymer films can undergo chain scission and contract . using this effect tightly focused laser light is shown to develop runaway near field concentration that drills sub nm pits through a thin film . this subwavelength photolithography can be controlled in real time by monitoring laser scatter from the evolving holes allowing systematic control of the void diameter . our model shows how interference between the substrate and film together with near field focusing by the evolving crevice directs this formation and predicts minimum pit sizes in films of nm thickness on gold substrates . the smallest features so far are nm diameter pits using nm light focused onto polystyrene through a objective . such arrays of pits can be easily used as masks for fabricating more complex nanostructures such as plasmonic nanostructures and biomicrofluidic devices . this demonstration shows the potential for harnessing near field feedback in optical direct writing for nanofabrication .

title = synchronization crossover of polariton condensates in weakly disordered lattices

abstract = we demonstrate that the synchronization of a lattice of solid state condensates when intersite tunneling is switched on depends strongly on the weak local disorder . this finding is vital for implementation of condensate arrays as computation devices . the condensates here are nonlinear bosonic fluids of exciton polaritons trapped in a weakly disordered bose hubbard potential where the nearest neighboring tunneling rate can be dynamically tuned . the system can thus be tuned from a localized to a delocalized fluid as the number density or the josephson coupling between nearest neighbors increases . the localized fluid is observed as a lattice of unsynchronized condensates emitting at different energies set by the disorder potential . in the delocalized phase the condensates synchronize and long range order appears evidenced by narrowing of momentum and energy distributions new diffraction peaks in momentum space and spatial coherence between condensates . our paper identifies similarities and differences of this nonequilibrium crossover to the traditional bose glass to superfluid transition in atomic condensates .
